    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
    If you're a New York City resident and would like to see a change in your local street tree landscape, take a look at the NYC Parks <a href= "https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/street-tree-planting/request">Tree Service Request system</a>!
    And if you'd like to get more involved, there are opportunities to become a <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship"> tree steward </a> or join <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/opportunities/volunteer">volunteer events</a>.

    <h2>Reading the Charts</h2>
    The radar charts presented on this website represent the different street tree plantings around the city, and when in the year they are at their peak bloom.
    Our radar chart has six spokes, going from early spring to late summer. The number of trees in peak bloom at a given time 
    is plotted on the axis formed by that spoke, with the 0 point of each axis at the center of the chart. The different graphs on this 
    website have different scales based on the overall number of trees in the neighborhood, borough, or entire city that is being plotted.
    The trees are grouped by the color of their flowers and each colors if plotted separately, forming several different "petals" on each graph.

    <h2>Authors</h2>
    This website was created as a mock up for MIT's Data Storytelling Studio class (CMS.6631). The <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/03/05/the-city-in-bloom/"> initial analysis </a> was done by Xio Alvarez, Trish Cafferkey, & Cynthia Hua. The project was further developed and evaluated for impact by Xio Alvarez, Eileen Hu & Olivia Yao.
