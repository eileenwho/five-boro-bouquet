    <h2>Reading the Graph</h2>
    The radial charts presented on this website represent the different street tree plantings around the city, and when in the year they are at their peak bloom.
    Progressing around the chart, we go from early spring to late summer. The length of the "petals" represent the number of trees (in the thousands) that have the specified flower color and are blooming at a certain time.

    <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
    If you're a New York City resident and would like to see a change in your local street tree landscape, take a look at the NYC Parks <a href= "https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/street-tree-planting/request">Tree Service Request system</a>!
    And if you'd like to get more involved, there are opportunities to become a <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship"> tree steward </a> or join <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/opportunities/volunteer">volunteer events</a>.

    <h2>Authors</h2>
    This website was created as a mock up for MIT's Data Storytelling Studio class (CMS.6631). The <a href="https://datastudio2020.datatherapy.org/2020/03/05/the-city-in-bloom/"> initial analysis </a> was done by Xio Alvarez, Trish Cafferkey, & Cynthia Hua. The project was further developed and evaluated for impact by Xio Alvarez, Eileen Hu & Olivia Yao.
